# This is the recipe file of the basebackpack
# here we define the name of the backpack
name: BackPack 

# here we define the size of the backpack (Note: it most be a multiple of 9 and under 54, you can choose for a bigger one but the gui will look weird)
size: 27

# here we define the recipe, you can easily change this, to use sub-ids, format it like this: id:subid
recipe line 1: 334|334|334
recipe line 2: 334|54|334
recipe line 3: 334|334|334

# what item will be used as backpack? (sub-ids are not supported here due to bukkit/minecraft issues)

# the maximum ammount of backpacks a player can have, you can define your own bypass permission
# if you set the permission to false it will use 'backpacks.max.bypass'
max:

# Since version 4.0 you can add item blacklists to the backpack, to disallow specified items.
# Only ids will work, sub-id's not yet supported.

# You can easy add extra backpacks, just make a new file in plugins/BackPacks/recipes but make sure it is a .yml file
# I suggest you to use notepad++ for this.
