# BackPacks++ by CaptainBern!

#    You can easily create new types of backpacks by simply adding a file with the '.yml' extension to the
#    recipes list. The easiest way is just to copy the original BaseBackPack.yml file and change the values to
#    whatever you want. Also the plugin often updates so there are new backpack features, if the plugin suddenly doesn't work
#    anymore then first take a look at the error.txt or log.txt file, (located at: plugin/BackPacks) if these files aren't present
#    then check the console for errors. Then report those errors back to me at bukkit-dev.
# Make a backup of the configuration! (It auto updates ever new build! (since too many people started complaining the plugin
#  didn't work, because of an outdated config))
# Do NOT change the version
version: 4.0.1

# Should I notify you when there is a new version?
update-checker: true

# Do you want to support the plugin by letting it use metrics? (please don't disable this)
metrics: true

# Here you can define if the plugin logs several things like who registered a backpack at which time
# and who tried to open someone else's backpack...
log: true

# The plugins has multi-world support
multiworld:
    enabled: false           
    worlds:
